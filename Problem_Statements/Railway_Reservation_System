The current railway reservation system encounters difficulties in handling a large volume of bookings, optimizing seat allocation, facilitating cancellations and refunds, and integrating with other transportation networks. These issues result in booking congestion, seat conflicts, refund delays, and limited travel planning options. To overcome these challenges, there is a need for an improved railway reservation system that focuses on robust booking management, efficient seat allocation algorithms, transparent cancellation and refund processes, and seamless integration with other transportation systems to enhance travel planning and customer satisfaction.
