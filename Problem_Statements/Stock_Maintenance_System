These issues result in stockouts, procurement delays, tracking errors, and suboptimal inventory levels. To address these challenges, there is a need for an improved stock maintenance system that focuses on real-time stock tracking, automated replenishment, reliable auditing mechanisms, and seamless integration with sales and purchasing systems to optimize stock management and enhance overall efficiency.
