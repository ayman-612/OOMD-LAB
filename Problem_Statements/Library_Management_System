The existing library management system faces challenges in effectively cataloging and indexing resources, managing borrowing and returns, ensuring fair access to popular materials, and maintaining asset security. These issues lead to inefficient resource retrieval, conflicts in borrowing, limited availability, and security vulnerabilities. To overcome these challenges, an enhanced library management system is required, with an emphasis on automated cataloging, streamlined circulation processes, robust reservation mechanisms, and improved asset security to optimize library operations and enhance patron satisfaction.
